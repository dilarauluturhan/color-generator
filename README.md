## About The Project
![](https://github.com/dilarauluturhan/color-generator/assets/120499369/1f17286b-459a-462f-89a5-e8f13a2280f8)

## Features
I developed an interactive color rendering tool using React.js. I used the values.js library in the project. values.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating color values. Using this library in the project, I take the color values entered by the user and create different color tones. In the project I also used the navigator.clipboard API so that users can copy the colors. In this way, they can quickly copy the color values they create to their clipboards and use them in other applications.

## Design
In this project, I used Pure CSS for the design.

## Built With
I created this project using the React.js and Values.js.
